# Development Log

This document records significant development milestones and lessons learned during the implementation of the `trop` port reservation tool.

## 2025-10-14 - Phase 2: SQLite Database Layer

Implemented the complete SQLite database persistence layer for port reservations. This phase established the foundation for storing and retrieving reservation data with proper concurrency support and transaction safety.

The implementation went smoothly overall, with all 12 core tasks completed successfully. Key accomplishments include:

- Database connection management with auto-creation and proper SQLite pragmas (WAL mode, busy timeout)
- Schema versioning framework ready for future migrations
- Complete CRUD operations for reservations with proper transaction handling
- Query operations optimized with appropriate indices
- Batch transaction helpers for atomic multi-reservation operations
- Comprehensive test coverage: 121 tests passing (99 unit + 10 integration + 5 common + 7 CLI + 49 doc tests)

The one deviation from the original plan was Task 12 (performance benchmarks with Criterion), which was not implemented. This was an optional enhancement listed in the testing section, and its absence doesn't affect functionality or subsequent phases. The phase achieved all its success criteria and is fully operational.

One notable success was the concurrent access testing: the integration test suite includes tests with 10 concurrent writers and mixed reader/writer scenarios, all passing reliably. This validates the WAL mode configuration and IMMEDIATE transaction strategy.

The database module is well-organized with clear separation between schema definition, connection management, migrations, and operations. Error handling properly converts rusqlite errors to domain errors with helpful context. The code is ready for Phase 3 (Path Handling System).

## 2025-10-14 - Phase 3: Path Handling System

Implemented the comprehensive path handling system with normalization, canonicalization, and relationship checking. This phase establishes critical infrastructure for managing filesystem paths with provenance awareness and proper validation.

The implementation went very smoothly, with all 12 tasks completed successfully. Key accomplishments include:

- Path normalization with tilde expansion, `.` and `..` resolution, and absolute path handling
- Path canonicalization with symlink following and loop detection
- PathResolver abstraction supporting explicit, implicit, and canonical resolution modes
- Path relationship detection (ancestor/descendant/same/unrelated) with transitive validation
- Provenance tracking distinguishing user-provided vs system-inferred paths
- Property-based tests using proptest for invariant validation (idempotency, reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity)
- Integration with database layer for path relationship validation
- Performance benchmarks for critical path operations
- Comprehensive test coverage: 177 tests passing (unit, integration, property-based, and doc tests)

The implementation required careful consideration of platform differences, particularly around symlink handling. All symlink-related tests are properly gated with `#[cfg(unix)]` to ensure cross-platform compatibility. The property-based tests were particularly valuable for validating mathematical properties of path relationships.

One notable design decision was the three-mode resolver approach (explicit, implicit, canonical), which provides fine-grained control over canonicalization behavior based on path provenance. This aligns perfectly with the specification's requirements for handling user-provided vs system-inferred paths differently.

The path handling module is well-organized with clear separation of concerns: normalization, canonicalization, relationship checking, and resolver abstraction are all independent and composable. Error handling properly distinguishes between different failure modes (not found, permission denied, path relationship violations). The code is ready for Phase 4 (Basic Reservation Operations).
